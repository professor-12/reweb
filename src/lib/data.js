    },
    {
        question: "How is Reweb different from tools like Framer or webflow?",
        answers:
            "Reweb is focused on developers and it's built on top of Next.js, Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, the most popular tech stack for building websites in the React ecosystem. This means that you can export your Reweb website to a Next.js project and continue building your app with the same tech stack. Also, Reweb is not limited to just marketing websites.",

    {
        question: "What is the learning curve of Reweb?",
        answers:
            "Reweb is built on top of popular technologies that most frontend developers are familiar with. You don't have to learn new mental models or frameworks. If you're familiar with HTML, React & Tailwind, building with Reweb will feel like writing code but visually.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is the genrated code hight quality?",
        answers:
            "Yes, our goal is to give you code that you can easily mantain and customize. If you're familiar with Next.js and Tailwind, the code will be very familiar and you'll be able to customize it with no issues. Here's an example of a generated component. When exporting the entire app, the code is based on this template, which is a standard Next.js app created with create-next-app.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you plan to add more sections and templates?",
        answers:
            "Yes! We plan to add a lot more sections and templates. Our goal is to have enough pre-built components so you rarely have to build from scratch. Also, you can use AI to generate components that we don't provide by default. If you have specific requests, feel free to ask in our Discord .",

    {
        question: "Can i import my own components?",
        answers:
            "Yes! You can import custom React, Tailwind and shadcn/ui components by pasting the code. You'll then be able to customize them visually within Reweb.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you have a team plan?",
        answers:
            "The team plan will publicly launch in January 2025. If you want early access you can contact us at mattia@reweb.so.",
